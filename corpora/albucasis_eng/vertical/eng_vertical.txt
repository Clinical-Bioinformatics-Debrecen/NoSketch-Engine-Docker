AFTER
finishing
for
you
,
my
sons
,
this
book
which
is
the
part
of
knowledge
dealing
with
medicine
in
its
entirety
;
and
having
made
it
as
clear
and
explicit
as
possible
,
I
thought
it
well
to
complete
it
for
you
by
adding
this
treatise
which
concerns
surgical
operating
.
</s>
<s id="1">
For
the
skilled
practitioner
of
operative
surgery
is
totally
lacking
in
our
land
and
time
;
so
that
the
knowledge
of
it
is
on
the
point
of
being
blotted
out
and
its
remains
lost
;
and
there
is
nothing
left
of
it
except
a
few
traces
in
the
books
of
the
Ancients
;
where
,
however
,
it
has
been
so
corrupted
by
the
hands
of
scribes
,
and
subjected
to
error
and
confusion
,
that
its
meaning
has
become
obscured
and
its
value
diminished
.
</s>
<s id="2">
Therefore
I
decided
to
revive
this
art
by
expounding
,
elucidating
,
and
epitomizing
it
in
this
treatise
;
and
to
present
the
forms
of
the
cauterizing
irons
and
other
operative
instruments
,
since
this
is
an
adjunct
to
explanation
and
a
vital
necessity
.
</s>
<s id="3">
Now
this
is
the
reason
why
there
is
no
skilful
operator
in
our
day
:
the
art
of
medicine
is
long
and
it
is
necessary
for
its
exponent
,
before
he
exercises
it
,
to
be
trained
in
anatomy
as
Galen
has
described
it
,
so
that
he
may
be
fully
acquainted
with
the
uses
,
forms
,
and
temperament
of
the
limbs
;
also
how
they
are
jointed
,
and
how
they
may
be
separated
;
that
he
should
understand
fully
also
the
bones
,
tendons
,
and
muscles
,
their
numbers
and
their
attachments
;
and
also
the
bloodvessels
,
both
arteries
and
veins
,
with
their
relations
.
</s>
<s id="4">
And
so
Hippocrates
said
:
'
Though
many
are
doctors
in
name
,
few
are
in
reality
,
particularly
on
the
surgical
side
.
'
</s>
<s id="5">
We
have
already
spoken
of
this
in
the
introduction
to
this
book
.

<s id="6">
For
he
who
is
not
skilled
in
as
much
anatomy
as
we
have
mentioned
is
bound
to
fall
into
error
that
is
destructive
of
life
.
</s>
<s id="7">
Thus
I
have
seen
many
laying
claim
to
this
knowledge
and
boasting
of
it
,
but
having
neither
knowledge
nor
experience
.
</s>
<s id="8">
I
saw
an
ignorant
doctor
incise
a
scrofulous
tumour
in
a
woman
's
neck
;
and
he
cut
certain
arteries
in
the
neck
so
that
the
woman
bled
until
she
fell
dead
before
him
.
</s>
<s id="9">
And
I
saw
another
doctor
presume
to
take
out
a
stone
from
a
man
of
advanced
age
.
</s>
<s id="10">
The
stone
was
large
;
he
rushed
blindly
at
the
task
and
extracted
the
stone
and
with
it
a
piece
of
the
bladder
itself
;
and
the
man
was
dead
in
about
three
days
.
</s>
<s id="11">
I
had
myself
been
previously
called
in
to
extract
the
stone
but
from
what
I
saw
of
the
size
of
it
and
the
condition
of
the
patient
I
judged
that
the
outcome
would
be
so
.

<s id="12">
I
saw
another
doctor
who
had
a
regular
salary
from
one
of
the
high
officers
of
our
country
for
medical
treatment
.
</s>
<s id="13">
There
had
occurred
to
a
negro
boy
of
his
a
fracture
of
the
leg
near
the
heel
,
together
with
a
wound
;
the
doctor
rushed
in
,
in
his
ignorance
,
and
bound
up
the
fracture
,
over
the
wound
,
very
tightly
,
with
pads
and
splints
,
not
allowing
the
wound
to
breathe

<s id="14">
He
then
let
him
go
as
he
wished
and
then
dismissed
him
for
some
days
bidding
him
not
to
loose
the
bandage
.
</s>
<s id="15">
Eventually
his
leg
and
foot
swelled
and
he
was
close
to
death
.
</s>
<s id="16">
I
was
called
in
and
made
haste
to
loose
the
bandage
,
upon
which
some
ease
and
reduction
of
the
pain
followed
.

<s id="17">
Nevertheless

gangrene
had
already
taken
hold
on
the
limb

I
could
not
hinder
its
progress
;
it
.

<s id="18">
continued
to
extend
in
the
limb
until
he
perished
.

<s id="19">
And
I
saw
another
doctor
incise
a
malignant
tumour
;
after
some
days
the
place
broke
out
in
open
ulceration

thereby
adding
to
the
misery
of
the
patient

<s id="20">
For

<s id="21">
Wherefore
you
must
know
,
my

that
operative
surgery
is
divided

operation
is
associated
with
the
health
of

out

<s id="29">

<s id="39">

similarly

<s id="40">
BOOK
ONE

<s id="41">
ON
CAUTERIZATION
</s>
<s id="42">
Before
we
expatiate
on
the
actual
operation
of
cautery
it
is
necessary
to
mention
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
the
temperament
upon
which
it
is
to
be
used
.
</s>
<s id="43">
I
say
that
a
discourse
on
the
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
cautery
is
a
long
one
,
a
subtle
learning
,
a
hidden
secret
.
</s>
<s id="44">
A
great
number
of
wise
men
have
spoken
on
the
subject
with
differing
opinions
.
</s>
<s id="45">
Lest
I
should
be
over
long
I
have
reduced
their
opinions
to
a
summary
.
</s>
<s id="46">
Now
I
say
that
the
cautery
has
universal
application
for
every
ill
constitution
,
whether
organic
or
functional
,
with
the
exception
of
two
:
the
functional
hot
temperament
and
the
functional
dry
temperament
.
</s>
<s id="47">
About
the
organic
dry
temperament
the
Ancients
differed
,
some
saying
that
cautery
helps
in
a
constitution
of
this
kind
,
while
others
said
the
opposite
:
that
cautery
is
of
no
use
in
a
disease
caused
by
heat
or
dryness
;
for
fire
is
naturally
hot
and
dry
and
it
is
obviously
absurd
to
treat
a
hot
dry
sickness
with
a
hot
dry
remedy
.
</s>
<s id="48">
But
he
who
holds
the
opposite
view
says
that
actual
cautery
may
help
in
the
case
of
such
hot
dry
illnesses
as
arise
in
the
human
body
;
for
when
you
compare
the
human
body
,
humid
as
it
is
,
with
the
nature
of
fire
you
find
the
human
body
cold
.
</s>
<s id="49">
I
myself
from
much
experience
agree
with
this
last
opinion
.
</s>
<s id="50">
However
,
no
one
should
attempt
this
operation
unless
he
has
had
long
training
and
practice
in
the
use
of
the
cautery
,
and
is
fully
acquainted
with
the
various
human
temperaments
,
and
the
character
of
the
complaints
in
themselves
;
their
causes
,
symptoms
,
and
duration
.
</s>
<s id="51">
Concerning
the
rest
of
the
temperaments
there
is
no
reason
for
fear
,
particularly
the
cold
and
humid
distempers
;
all
medical
men
are
agreed
and
none
differs
concerning
the
utility
of
the
cautery
in
such
cases
.
</s>
<s id="52">
Now
you
should
know
,
my
sons
,
that
the
actual
cautery
and
its
superiority
over
cauterization
with
chemical
caustics
is
one
of
the
secrets
of
medicine
.
</s>
<s id="53">
For
fire
is
a
simple
substance
having
no
action
except
upon
the
actual
part
cauterized
;
nor
does
it
do
more
than
slightly
harm
any
adjacent
part
.
</s>
<s id="54">
But
the
effect
of
cauterization
with
caustic
may
spread
to
parts
at
a
distance
from
that
burnt
;
and
also
in
the
part
cauterized
it
may
give
rise
to
a
disease
difficult
to
cure
or
even
fatal
.
</s>
<s id="55">
Whereas
fire
,
on
the
other
hand
,
on
account
of
the
nobility
of
its
nature
and
its
superiority
has
no
such
effect
unless
it
is
overdone
.
</s>
<s id="56">
That
has
become
clear
to
us
by
experience
through
length
of
service
,
devotion
to
the
art
,
and
acquaintance
with
the
facts
of
the
matter
.
</s>
<s id="57">
So
I
need
not
prolong
this
discourse
.
</s>
<s id="58">
Were
it
not
inappropriate
to
this
my
book
I
should
relate
to
you
a
deep
secret
concerning
fire
,
the
manner
of
its
action
on
bodies
and
its
expulsion
of
diseases
;
with
a
reasoned
philosophical
discourse
too
subtle
for
your
understanding
.
</s>
<s id="59">
Know
also
,
my
sons
,
that
the
Ancients
disagreed
also
as
to
the
fit
time
for
cautery
,
affirming
that
spring
was
the
best
.
</s>
<s id="60">
Myself
,
I
say
that
the
cautery
is
suitable
at
all
times
;
for
whatever
harm
may
arise
from
the
season
of
the
operation
is
utterly
outdone
by
the
benefit
deriving
from
the
cauterization
itself
;
especially
if
the
cautery
is
applied
to
pains
that
are
severe
,
grievous
,
and
swift
,
brooking
no
delay
,
because
of
the
fear
that
the
consequences
may
be
more
grave
than
the
slight
harm
from
the
season
.
</s>
<s id="61">
Nor
let
enter
your
minds
,
my
sons
,
the
groundless
notion
of
the
laity
and
of
ignorant
doctors
,
that
the
complaint
cured
by
the
cautery
never
comes
back
later
;
do
not
cleave
to
this
opinion
.
</s>
<s id="62">
The
fact
is
not
as
they
think
;
for
the
cautery
is
homologous
to
the
drug
which
alters
the
constitution
and
dries
up
the
humidities
that
give
rise
to
disorders
.
</s>
<s id="63">
But
the
cautery
excels
the
drug
by
the
rapidity
of
its
success
,
the
strength
of
its
action
,
and
the
potency
of
its
powers
.
</s>
<s id="64">
It
may
be
that
the
disease
will
return
at
some
time
according
to
the
temperament
of
the
patient
,
and
the
persistence
and
virulence
of
the
disease
;
and
from
the
formation
of
a
mass
of
superfluities
in
the
body
;
from
his
neglect
of
himself
in
acquiring
them
from
food
;
and
from
causes
of
a
similar
nature
.
</s>
<s id="65">
Of
course
,
if
the
disease
to
which
the
cautery
is
applied
be
a
slight
one
,
and
in
a
part
only
slightly
liable
to
superfluities
and
humidities
,
as
,
for
example
,
the
cauterization
of
a
molar
tooth
for
toothache
,
and
the
like
,
then
it
may
happen
that
the
pain
does
not
return
;
but
that
happens
rarely
.
</s>
<s id="66">
Another
common
saying
is
that
the
cautery
is
the
final
remedy
;
which
is
true
,
but
not
in
the
way
which
they
mean
.
</s>
<s id="67">
For
they
believe
that
after
cauterization
no
treatment
,
either
with
or
without
medicine
,
will
help
.
</s>
<s id="68">
It
means
something
precisely
the
opposite
:
after
various
treatments
have
been
applied
to
a
certain
disorder
without
success
,
then
last
of
all
we
apply
cauterization
and
this
proves
effective
;
whence
comes
about
the
saying
that
the
cautery
is
the
final
remedy
—
not
in
that
sense
in
which
it
is
popularly
held
by
the
laity
and
by
many
ignorant
medical
men
.
</s>
<s id="69">
The
Ancients
have
stated
that
cauterization
by
gold
is
more
effective
than
by
iron
.
</s>
<s id="70">
Now
they
said
that
on
account
of
the
temperateness
of
gold
and
its
noble
character
.
</s>
<s id="71">
They
also
stated
that
the
site
of
cauterization
does
not
become
purulent
,
but
that
is
not
absolutely
so
;
for
I
myself
have
experience
of
that
and
have
found
that
it
happens
in
some
cases
and
not
in
other
cases
.
</s>
<s id="72">
Cauterization
by
gold
is
indeed
better
and
more
successful
than
with
iron
,
as
they
have
stated
;
except
that
when
you
are
heating
the
gold
cautery
in
the
fire
you
are
uncertain
,
by
reason
of
the
redness
of
the
gold
,
when
it
reaches
the
desired
temperature
.
</s>
<s id="73">
In
addition
to
this
it
cools
very
quickly
;
and
if
you
overheat
it
it
melts
in
the
fire
,
melts
and
runs
,
and
the
practitioner
finds
himself
in
difficulties
.
</s>
<s id="74">
Therefore
in
our
own
opinion
cauterization
is
swifter
and
more
successful
with
iron
.

<s id="75">
Now
I
have
arranged
this
book
on
cauterization
by
chapters
,
set
in
order
from

to
make
it
easy
for
the
seeker
to
find
what
he
wants

therefore
I

<s id="652">
I
have
seen
a
child
whose

was
filled
with
fluid

daily
growing
in

not
sit
upright

Now
this

The
operation
is
thus
:
when
the
humidity

small

an
incision

be
made
in
the

transversely

<s id="655">
The
length

<s id="658">
But
if
the
humidity
is
beneath

the
sign

that
you

see
the

gaping

the

manifestly
yielding

you
press

you

make
three

<s id="659">
After
incising

draw
out

up

The

<s id="1240">
They

One
is
the

the

<s id="1242">
The
other
is
the
part
of
the
body
where
it
occurs
.
</s>
<s id="1243">
For
the
tumour
occurring
in
the
head
is
different
from
the
tumour
occurring
on
the
posterior
,
and
a
tumour
occurring
in
a
fleshy
part
differs
from
one
on
the
joints
;
each
having
its
separate
category
of
operation
.
</s>
<s id="1244">
There
are
some
tumours
that
should
not
be
opened
till
after
the
pus

<s id="1245">
But
others
should
be
opened
when
still
raw

immature

a
tumour
near
the
joints
.
</s>
<s id="1246">
For
when
a
tumour
occurring
near
a
joint
lasts
long
enough
to
putrefy
its
surroundings
,
it
often
breaks
down
the
ligaments
or
the
tendons
of
the
joint
and
causes
paralysis
in
the
limb
.
</s>
<s id="1247">
Or
if
the
tumour
be
near
a
major
organ
,
if
you
delay
the
opening
of
it
until
it
ripens
you
will
damage
that
major
organ
.

<s id="1248">
In

must
open
it

<s id="1249">
The
reason
why
you
must
open
an
abscess
near
the
anus
while
still
unripe
,
before
it
is
brought
to
a
head
,
is
to
prevent
it
from
putrefying
the
cleft
and
penetrating
to
the
inner
part
of
the
anus
and
becoming
a
fistula
,
and
incurable
.
</s>
<s id="1250">
It
is
necessary
too
to
know
the
time
to
open
fully
mature
swellings
:
it
is
when
the
pain
of
the
swelling
is
lessened
,
the
fever
departs
,
the
redness
and
the
throbbing
are
reduced
,
and
the
head
of
the
abscess
becomes
wrinkled
,
with
other
signs
.
</s>
<s id="1251">
The
perforation
should
be
made
in
the
lower
part
of
the
swelling
if
possible
,
so
that
the
pus
may
more
easily
drain
downwards
;
or
else
in
the
thinnest
and
most
swollen
part
of
the
swelling
.

<s id="1252">
Your
incision
should
be
longitudinal

places

In

the
place

<s id="1254">
But
when
the
swelling
is
in
the
fleshy
parts
it
is
best
to
leave
the

we
have
said
,
until
it
is
fully
matured
.

<s id="1255">
For
if
you
perforate
it
prematurely
the
sanious
discharge
will
go
on
longer
and
will
be
excessively
foul

both
the
edges

the
depths
of
the
opening
will
become
indurated

<s id="1256">
Some
swellings
are
perforated
latitudinally
if
necessary
,
or
having
regard
to
the
requirement
of
the
part
.

<s id="1257">
In
small
swellings
you
should
use
a
single
perforation
;

ones
you
should
use
wide
or
multiple
perforations
according
to
the
size
of
the
swelling
.

<s id="1258">
There
are
also
some
swellings
that

a
circular
incision

skin
,

should
be
cut
when
they
have
become

necrosed
—
which
actually
happens
often
in
abscesses
and
sinuses

a
small
incision
transversely

this

when

obstructed
the

's
throat

he
is
approaching
death

is

himself

incised
,
they
resort
to
laryngotomy

that
the

may
breathe
somewhat

his
life
be
saved

<s id="1331">
My

I
laid
the

assured
myself
that
neither
the
jugular

been
cut

air

out

of
two
kinds

The

the
superiority

<s id="1567">
For
scissors
cut
evenly
,
since
the
upper
edge
of

scissors
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
lower
edge
;
and
so
,
as
you
compress
your
hand
,
thanks
to
the
correspondence
of
the
two
blades
you
cut
equally
and
simultaneously
;
and
you
make
the
girdle
of
the
thread
like
a
wall
all
round
the
skin
of
the
tip
of
the
penis
:
thus
no
error
can
occur
.

<s id="1568">
The
manner
of
operating
is
first
to
make
the
boy
,
especially
if
he
is
one
who
understands
a
little
,
imagine
that
all
you
are
going
to
do
is
tie
a
ligature
on
the
tip
of
the
penis
and
leave
it
for
another
day
.

<s id="1569">
Then
amuse
him
and
cheer
him
as
much
as
you
can
,
according
to
his
intelligence
;
then
stand
him
upright
before
you
,
not
sitting
;
and
hide
the
scissors
in
your
sleeve
or
under
your
foot
and
do
not
let
the
boy
's
eye
chance
upon
that
or
any
other
instrument
.

<s id="1570">
Then
with
your
hand
take
hold
of
the
tip
of
the
penis
,
blow
into
the
foreskin
,
and
draw
it
back
till
the
glans
penis
is
exposed
;
then
cleanse
from
it
all
unclean
matter
that
has
collected

<s id="1571">
Then
ligate
the
indicated

with

right
round

then
take
hold
at
the
site

very
firmly

cut

then
quickly
push
back
the

draw
out
the

then
let
a
little
blood
flow
,
for
that
is
all
the
better
and

wipe

A
watery
hernia

a
collection
of
fluid
in
the
white
membrane
lying
beneath
the
skin
surrounding
the
testicle
,
which
is
called
the
scrotum
.

<s id="1685">
Sometimes
it
has
a
capsule
of
its
own
which
nature
has
formed
alongside
the
testis

that
one
would
think
it
another
testicle
;
it
may
also
form
between
the
skin
of
the
scrotum
and
the
white
membrane
which
we
mentioned
;
however
,
this
occurs
very
rarely

<s id="1686">
This
hernia
arises
from

from
a
blow
upon
the
testicles

sometimes
yellowish

sometimes
blood

red

the
fluid
is
watery
-
pale

this
actually
is
the
commonest
.

<s id="1729">

there
is
no
water
to
it
.

<s id="1732">
The
lump
will
be
solid
and
often
will
be
stony
hard
,
of
a
dark
colour
,
and
without
sensation

<s id="1733">
Sometimes
also
it
arises
from
a
knotting

inflation
of
the
veins
.

<s id="1734">
The
sort
arising
from
a
swelling

may
be
recognized
by
a
dispersal
of

you
press

<s id="1736">
It

sometimes
possible

also
on

:
make
an
incision

then
draw

<s id="1737">
Should
it
happen

But

A

<s id="1746">
So
I

push
down

take
hold

draw
out
strongly

<s id="1747">
Then
with
a
broad
sharp

make
an

that
the

laid
bare
.

<s id="1748">
Then
dissect
on

sides
in
the

way

I
told
you
for
extracting
the

<s id="1749">
Then
run
through
them
a
needle
doubly
threaded

tie
at
the
spot

the
varix
begins

tie
it
again
where
the
varix
ends

then
cut
through
the
varix
in
the
middle
with
an
incision
at
right
angles
to
the
length

draw
out
the

Then
dress

there
is
no
harm
in
that

<s id="1751">
But
if

you

have
to

<s id="1754">
This

<s id="1755">
Through

<s id="1756">
And
these

with
a

severe
pain
,

the
lump
varies
in
consistency

appearing
close

that
is
due

the
emergence

its
passage
outside
the

<s id="1759">
Sometimes
also
the

He

,
if

On

<s id="1807">
Castration
is
forbidden
in
our
law
and
I
ought
therefore
to
make
no
mention
of
it
in
my
book
.
</s>
<s id="1808">
But
I
must
speak
of
it
for
two
reasons
.
</s>
<s id="1809">
One
reason
is
that
it
should
be
part
of
the
doctor
's
medical
knowledge
when
asked
about
it
,
and
that
he
should
know
how
to
treat
anyone
whom
it
befalls
.
</s>
<s id="1810">
Another
reason
is
that
often
we
need
to
castrate
certain
animals
for
the
sake
of
the
benefits
that
accrue
from
them
,
such
as
rams
,
he
-
goats
and
cats
,
and
such
animals
.
</s>
<s id="1811">
So
I
say
that
castration
can
be
performed
in
two
ways
:
either
by
contusion
;
or
by
opening
up
and
cutting
away
.
</s>
<s id="1812">
The
method
by
contusion
is
that
we
make
the
animal
sit
in
warm
water
until
his
testes
are
relaxed
and
become
soft
and
pendent
;
then
rub
them
with
your
hand
until
they
are
so
loosened
that
they
are
no
longer
palpable
.
</s>
<s id="1813">
As
to
castration
by
open
operation
and
excision
,
the
animal
should
be
held
and
pressure
put
upon
the
scrotum
with
the
left
hand
.
</s>
<s id="1814">
Then
tie
the
spermatic
cord
and
with
one
incision
cut
down
upon
both
testicles
so
that
both
are
brought
up
out
of
the
scrotum
.
</s>
<s id="1815">
After
dissecting
them
away
cut
them
off
;
do
not
leave
any
of
the
coverings
upon
them
except
the
thin
membrane
covering
the
vessels
.
</s>
<s id="1816">
This
manner
of
castration
is
better
than
the
contusion
method
,
for
contusion
often
leaves
something
of
the
testicles
,
and
the
animal
desires
to
couple

I
shall
describe
each
one
to
you
separately
,
with
comments
and
explanation

<s id="2170">
I
begin
then
by
saying
that
when
the
wound
is
small
,
and
a
piece
of
intestine
protrudes
from
it
,
rendering
the
reduction
of
it
difficult
,
the
difficulty
will
be
due
to
one
of
two
causes
:
either
on
account
of
the
smallness
of
the
fissure
,
as
we

or
because
the
gut
has
become
inflated
on
account
of
the
coldness
of
the
air

<s id="2171">
If
the
latter
case
obtains
,
the
gut
must
be
warmed
by
fomenting
with
a
sponge

piece
of
cloth
bathed
with
warm
water
or
water
in
which
have
been
boiled
rushes
and
cyperus
and
hyacinth
,
bathing
the
gut
until
the
inflation
is
gone
down
.

<s id="2172">
Wine
that

astringent
may
do
;

down
the

better
than
plain
water

<s id="2173">
When
you
see
that
the
swelling
has
come
down
,
bathe
the
gut
with
water
in
which
have
been
infused
althea
and

<s id="2174">
But
if
after
this

open
up
the

opening
up
haemorrhoids

<s id="2175">
The
first
method

<s id="2178">
When
the
wound
is
opened
up
a

it

cut
off

When

pass
it
through

leave
the
edge
of
the
peritoneum

peritoneum

<s id="2208">
Then
reintroduce
into

<s id="2210">
In
short
,
this
way
of
suturing
is
to
sew
with
the
stitch
used
by
furriers
in
sewing
skins
;
thus
you
stitch
the
peritoneum
once
one
way
with
the
skin
edge
and
leave
it
once
the
other
way
,
until
you
have
done
.

<s id="2211">
Now
the
manner
of
the
second
type
of
special
stitch
which
Galen
mentioned
is
this
(

that
you
suture
it

<s id="2212">
That
is

they
suture

join

skin
margin
to
the
other

in
the
manner
I

You
should
put
the
needle

,
and
make
it
pass
inward

leaving
out

Some
have

may
be
performed
with
two
needles

:
you
thread
one
thread
into
both

<s id="2218">
Then
you
insert
the

the
manner

<s id="2219">
You
must
understand
that
when
the

sewing

it

more
difficult
than
in
other
parts

the
medical
treatment

But
if

You

discharges

it
a
defluxion

<s id="2248">
The
fistula
proper
is
a
compact
hard
white

account
some

I

abscesses

any
ulcer

would
not
heal
nor
show
growth

tissue
was
due

one
of
nine
causes

<s id="2251">
One
is
lack
,

poorness
,
of
blood
in
the
body

or
it
may
be
because
the
hardness
of
the
tissues
,
internally
and
at
the
edges
of
the
opening
,
prevents
the
growth
of
sound
tissue
;
or
it
may
be
because
of
the
abundance
of
foul
and
evil
matter
;
or
it
may
be
because
the
ulcer
is
necrotic
in
itself
and
the
matter
that
it
discharges
is
of
bad
quality
;
as
also
it
may
be
because
the
remedy
used
in
treating
it
is
not
suitable
;
or
again
it
may
be
because
of
corruption
arising
at
that
locality
,
of
the
nature
of
pestilence
;
or
it
may
be
due
to
something
special
and
peculiar
in
the
locality
—
as
happens
in
the
city
of
Saragossa
,
where
diseases
tend
to
linger

tumours
are
naturally
slow

more

On
the

<s id="2485">
Arrows
vary
both
as

types

the
different
parts
of
the
body
pierced
by
them

<s id="2486">
They
differ
thus
as
to
type
:
some
are
big
and
some
are
small
;
some
with
hollow
heads
and
some
with
solid
;
some
of
them
have
three
angles
and
some
four
;
some
have
tongues
;
some
have
spikes
.
</s>
<s id="2487">
The
difference
due
to
the
part
transfixed
by
the
arrow
is
twofold
:
for
there
are
either
the
chief
hollow
organs
such
as
the
brain
,
the
heart
,
the
liver
,
the
lungs
,
the
kidneys
,
intestine
,
bladder
,
and
so
forth
—
when
one
of
these
arrows
transfixes
an
organ
of
this
kind
,
and
you
observe
the
signs
of
death
which
I
shall
describe
to
you
later
,
then
you
must
avoid
the
extraction
of
the
arrow
in
that
case
,
for
death
will
generally
follow
;
but
when
you
do
not
see
these
fatal
signs
and
the
arrow
is
not
quite
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
organ
,
then
extract
it
and
dress
the
wound
.

<s id="2488">
Now
the
signs
when
the
arrow
has
struck
the
brain
,
and
penetrated
the
bone
and
injured
the
meninges
covering
the
brain
,
are
these
:
there
arise
from
that
a
violent
headache
and
vertigo
and
giddiness
and
a
redness
in
the
eye
,
and
a
redness
of
the
tongue
,
and
convulsion
and
mental
confusion
and
bilious
vomit
;
perhaps
also
blood
comes
out
of
the
nose
or
from
the
ears
;
often
also
the
speech
is
affected
and
the
voice
is
lost
;
also
there
comes
out
of
the
site
of
the
wound
a
white
fluid
which
resembles
gruel
,
from
which
there
flows
something
like
the
juice
of
meat

If

out

<s id="2490">
The
signs
of
an
arrow
in

heart
are
:
nearness
to
the
left
breast

the
patient
feels
it
as
if
it
were
fixed
in
something
solid
,
not
hollow
;
often
also
there
will
be
imparted
to
the
arrow
a
pulsating
movement
;
and
black
blood
will
issue
from
the
wound
;
and
after
this
follow
coldness
of
the
extremities

a
cold
sweat

unconsciousness
;

surely
on
its
way

<s id="2491">
The
sign
of
an
arrow
that
has
wounded
the
lung

the
exit

frothy
blood

the
wound

also
the
vessels
that
lie
along

neck
swell
up

But
if

strike

<s id="2494">
If

sunk
out

I

take
hold
only
of

it

I

<s id="2510">

wound

<s id="2512">
I
explored
it
with
a
fine
probe

did
not

the
patient
felt
a
pricking

a
pain
beneath
the
right
ear

I
hoped
that
the
pricking
was
due
to
the
arrow
.
</s>
<s id="2513">
So
I
applied
a
poultice
to
the
spot
,
a
poultice
with
power
to
draw
out

cause
suppuration
,
desiring
that
the
place
should
swell

that
a

appear

I
could
cut
down

<s id="2514">
But
nothing
happened
at

place

come
through

so
I
persevered
with
poulticing
it
for
many
days
;
yet
nothing
fresh
manifested
itself

the
wound
healed
up

the

despaired

<s id="2515">
Then
one
day
he
felt
the
arrow
inside
his

I
applied
a

I
explored

enlarged

<s id="2716">
What
cupping
does
is
to
draw
blood

over
the
flesh
;
for
this
reason
it
does
not
cause
the

Yet
nature
produces
around
the
bone
on
all
sides
something
like
glue
,
with
a
certain
viscosity

with
whose

it
joins

one
another

Galen

his
words

part

the
fracture

severest

most
obvious

sides
longitudinally
,
as
you

so
that
the

resting
upon
the
meninges
while
the
cutting
surface
is
on
the
bone
.

<s id="2933">
Then
with
a
small
hammer
strike
the
tool
on
one
side

gently
cut
through

circle
,
in
the
confident
knowledge
that
nothing
untoward
can
happen
to
the
membrane

the

cowardly
of
men

<s id="2934">
If

strip
it
off

displaced
down

<s id="3301">
A
dislocation
down

be
diagnosed
by
comparing
the
sound

for
you
will
find
an
obvious
difference

you
will
find
a
hollow
at
the
head

the
humerus
,
and
in
the
axilla
the
head
of
the
humerus
may
be
palpated

you
will
find
it
obvious
to
the
touch

not
hidden
.

<s id="3303">
The
reduction

dislocation
will
be
quite
simple

it
be

the

be

<s id="3304">
To
reduce
it

his

you

the
assistant
lifts

the
